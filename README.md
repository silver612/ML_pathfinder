# ML_pathfinder

The program in copy_of_yolov3.ipnyb was created by editing a pre-trained object detection program.
Instead of re-training the model, this program attempts to display a bounding box for human faces by taking the bounding boxes for the label 'person' and shifting it to the face according to basic human body proportions.
